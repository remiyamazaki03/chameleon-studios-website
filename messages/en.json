      "p1": "Chameleon Studios was founded in March 2024 by Remi Yamazaki.\n\nThe name “Chameleon” reflects Remi’s teaching style and teaching philosophy:",
      "p2": "<strong> Teaching style: </strong> Vocal command and agility require intricate inner muscle coordination, so using easy-to-remember animals to capture complex anatomical concepts is one of the reasons her lessons are both effective and entertaining, as well as kid-friendly (ages 8+).",
      "p3": "<strong>Teaching philosophy:</strong> Remi believes that everyone has a rainbow inside of them!  🌈 Bringing out all the different “colors” of students' voices - even the ones we don't realize we have - is one of her favorite things to do.",
      "p4": "Remi was born into a teachers' family and has been teaching for about 15 years. Her teaching experience includes directing a children's program (ages 4+) and training children's teachers. Her vocal students at !link! Chameleon Studios !link! have a wonderful time and her lessons are often the highlight of their week.",
      "p5": "<strong>Lesson flow:</strong>\n\n<strong>1) targeted warm-ups:</strong> customized to individual student strengths and needs \n\n<strong>2) targeted vocal exercises:</strong> this is where the hard work happens. Students work on targeted exercises to help them acquire new abilities and progress towards their personal singing goals and dreams.\n\n<strong>3) song work:</strong> students practice applying learned vocal techniques to a song of their choice.",
      "p6": "<strong>For kids:</strong> In addition to the above, kids' lessons include lesson goal setting and progress tracking in a notebook. After each lesson, students receive a sticker and parents receive a lesson report.",
