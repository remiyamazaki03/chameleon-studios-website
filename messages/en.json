    "teacher": {
      "p1": "Former member of the multiple Grammy Award-winning gospel choir, the <btc>Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir</btc>, Remi has shared the stage with renowned gospel and contemporary Christian artists like <mcdowell>William McDowell</mcdowell> and <grant>Natalie Grant</grant>.

      "p2": "Remi began singing gospel music as a member and soloist of her school choir and was a member of her church worship band by her teens. By her senior year of high school, she was directing an a cappella choir of eight singers, performing at various functions including an international Kanto (regional) choir festival in Tokyo.",

      "p3": "She earned her Bachelor's Degree in Comparative Literature (with a focus on theatrical literature) from Princeton University, where she also received classical vocal training from <cappon>Ronald Cappon</cappon>. As a member of the <chapel>Princeton University Chapel Choir</chapel>, she performed at St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna and as a soloist at the University Chapel. She also continued directing - this time for an a cappella group specializing in Southern African gospel and Afropop/Afrobeat.",
      "p4": "After relocating to New York City, she continued performing and classical training while expanding her musical horizons.

    "studio": {
      "p1": "Chameleon Studios was founded in March 2024 by Remi Yamazaki.\nThe name “Chameleon” reflects Remi’s teaching style and teaching philosophy:",
      "p2": "<strong>Teaching philosophy:</strong> Remi believes that everyone has a rainbow inside of them!  🌈 Bringing out all the different “colors” of students' voices - even the ones we don't realize we have - is one of her favorite things to do.",
      "p3": "<strong>Teaching style:</strong> Vocal command and agility require intricate inner muscle coordination, so using easy-to-remember animals to capture complex anatomical concepts is one of the reasons her lessons are both effective and entertaining, as well as kid-friendly (ages 8+).",
      "p4": "<strong>Lesson flow:</strong>\n<strong>1) targeted warm-ups:</strong> customized to individual student strengths and needs \n<strong>2) targeted vocal exercises:</strong> this is where the hard work happens. Students work on targeted exercises to help them acquire new abilities and progress towards their personal singing goals and dreams.\n<strong>3) song work:</strong> students practice applying learned vocal techniques to a song of their choice."

      "worship": "For worship leaders",
      "p1": "Worship leaders sing in a special setting where singing is not a performance but an invitation to join in worship, as well as an act of worship itself.\n\nWith experience in various forms of church music including contemporary worship bands, gospel choirs as well as traditional hymn leading, Remi loves to help worship leaders develop their vocal skills to [FINISH THIS SENTENCE].",
      "testimonial1": "I regularly lead worship, but I've never liked the sound of my own voice. I didn't even have the words to describe why, but after a few months with Remi, I began to understand. After that, the muscle memory started to take over. I started to really hear it in my own voice, that openness I associate with trained singers. I now like to listen to myself sing, which helps me trust that other people do, too!\n- worship leader in Seattle, USA (online)",
      "testimonial2": "I started taking online voice training because I wanted to sing more freely as a worship leader at my church and to reach higher notes with ease. Through the lessons, I learned not only how to control the transition into my high range but also how my body actually works. Now I feel much more comfortable expressing myself while singing and truly enjoy using my voice in worship.\n- worship leader in Tokyo, Japan (online)"

    "slide1": "During the lessons Remi always encouraged me. One of the exercises was making a pig face. She said “making an ugly face is part of the vocal lesson. Nothing to be ashamed of!” That's it. I had nothing to be ashamed of. After two months of training, I could sing songs which I never expected to sing.\n- T. K. (online, Brazil)",
    "slide2": "I didn't know I had this side of my voice!!! Given proper instruction, it was an amazing feeling to push past the limits I thought I had.\n\n- J. L. (online, USA)",
    "slide3": "I've been singing in a choral way for more than 20 years and singing in a different style was very challenging for me. Remi's way of teaching was very fun and also very easy to understand. Now I can use my chest voice to sing powerful songs and I even performed in front of an audience!! Her lessons definitely gave me confidence in singing!\n- A. T. (online, Japan)",
    "slide4": "I can’t believe I was able to do it… I thought [this song] was impossible. It was a dream come true to sing it.\n\n- Z. P. (in person, Japan)",
    "slide5": "something \n- hello",
    "slide6": "After Remi's coaching, [the coachee, one of the musical actors] sang notes I (thought I) knew he couldn't hit, all with 100% presence and confidence onstage. Remi encouraged and helped many of us to step up and boosted our production level, and I'm very grateful to have had the opportunity to work with her.\n- W. R-L. (Musical director, USA)"
