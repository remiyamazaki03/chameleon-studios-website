      "p1": "Former member of the multiple Grammy Award-winning gospel choir, the <btc>Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir</btc>, Remi has shared the stage with renowned gospel and contemporary Christian artists like <mcdowell>William McDowell</mcdowell> and <grant>Natalie Grant</grant>. She has also performed in New York City, including Off-Broadway venue <below>54 Below</below> and various jazz clubs.",
      "p2": "Remi began singing gospel music as a member and soloist of her school choir and was a member of her church worship band by her teens. By her senior year of high school, she was directing an a cappella choir of eight singers, performing at various functions including an international Kanto (regional) choir festival in Tokyo.",
      "p3": "She earned her Bachelor's Degree in Comparative Literature (with a focus on theatrical literature) from Princeton University, where she also received classical vocal training from <cappon>Ronald Cappon</cappon>. As a member of the <chapel>Princeton University Chapel Choir</chapel>, she performed at St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna and as a soloist at the University Chapel.

      "p1": "Chameleon Studios was founded in March 2024 by Remi Yamazaki.\nThe name “Chameleon” reflects Remi’s teaching style and teaching philosophy:",
      "p2": "<strong> Teaching style: </strong> Vocal command and agility require intricate inner muscle coordination, so using easy-to-remember animals to capture complex anatomical concepts is one of the reasons her lessons are both effective and entertaining, as well as kid-friendly (ages 8+).",
      "p3": "<strong>Teaching philosophy:</strong> Remi believes that everyone has a rainbow inside of them!  🌈 Bringing out all the different “colors” of students' voices - even the ones we don't realize we have - is one of her favorite things to do.",
      "p4": "Remi was born into a teachers' family and has been teaching for about 15 years. Her teaching experience includes directing a children's program (ages 4+) and training children's teachers. Her vocal students have a wonderful time and her lessons are often the highlight of their week.",
      "p5": "<strong>Lesson flow:</strong>\n<strong>1) targeted warm-ups:</strong> customized to individual student strengths and needs \n<strong>2) targeted vocal exercises:</strong> this is where the hard work happens. Students work on targeted exercises to help them acquire new abilities and progress towards their personal singing goals and dreams.\n<strong>3) song work:</strong> students practice applying learned vocal techniques to a song of their choice.",
      "p6": "<strong>For kids:</strong> In addition to the above, kids' lessons include lesson goal setting and progress tracking in a notebook. After each lesson, students receive a sticker and parents receive a lesson report."
